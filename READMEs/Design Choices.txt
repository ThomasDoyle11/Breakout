A list of some active design choices for Breakout (some to reduce complication, some for fun):

The client shall only be responsible for Input; all logic shall be performed on the host.
    This prevents any logic being duplicated.
   
The Ball shall only collide with the Paddle when travelling in the negative y direction (downwards), otherwise it shall pass straight through it.
    This will prevent the second player or a barrier reflecting the Ball, only for it to bounce off the back of the first player.
    
The game shall not limit the players lives, but instead count the number of times they 'died'.
    This allows progress to continue indefinitely whilst still measuring success.
    
Wider, Barrier, Faster and Hotball PowerUp effects shall not stack.
    This will prevent the Paddle becoming too wide, the Balls becoming too fast, and prevents the need to count the number of Hotballs and Barriers.

Multiball PowerUp effect shall stack.
    This is simple enough and the game can handle multiple balls in play.

Bricks shall be able to reflect Balls in both the X and Y direction at the same time if the Ball enters from the corner.
    This will allow more gameplay scenarios.

The Paddle shall reflect the Ball symmetrically when the Ball hits the Paddle within a certain range. Outside of this range, the Ball shall be reflected in the direction of the nearest edge of the Paddle at an angle between 0 and the maximum launch angle, interpolated between the threshold and the edge of the Paddle
    This allows the player to have some control over the movement of the ball and therefore more decision.
    
The host shall always launch the ball.
    This is for ease of design.
